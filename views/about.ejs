				I have been interested in software development since I was just 11 years old.
				As a kid, I would spend a lot of free time creating web sites and various 
				coding projects.

				I joined the US Navy shortly after highschool to see the world, where
				I worked hard but as a result gained a lot of experience and had many
				adventures.

				I've spent the last four years finishing undergraduate and graduate degrees
				and worked on projects during my spare time which has included web development,
				mobile and desktop applications.
